		<h1>Information</h1>
		<hr>
		<p>Q engine, or Qeng, is an open source WebGL 3D game engine in active development.
			The engine started as a final project for an intro to computer graphics class,
			and is since being updated with the goal of developing a highly versatile 3D
			engine, providing developers a wide range of capabilities to make 3D games and
			programs, designed in a modular manner intended to ease development. <br><br>
			Current features:
		<ul>
			<li>Dynamic mesh updating- modify the location of any number of points in any mesh in real time</li>
			<li>Material system- utilize PBR textures to create realistic materials, or specify parameters for many
				unique material types (emissive, transparent, specular and diffusive, unlit)</li>
			<li>Sophisticated lighting- support currently for up to 64 lights, with customizable parameters to cast on
				materials differently, and negative and translucent lighting</li>
			<li>Postrpocess layer- supports 10+ buffer inputs</li>
			<li>Object system- create parent-child relationships with 3D primitives to control multiple objects as one
			</li>
			<li>Gameplay update mechanics- tick-based updating with optional customizable functions to be called before
				or after tick/graphics/input</li>
			<li>Buffered input controls- Handle all inputs by the player in the order they arrive, not missing any
				inputs</li>
			<li>Separate graphics thread- Updates visuals independently from game logic</li>
			<li>Camera system- swap between multiple cameras in the 3D environment, with orthographic and perspective
				options, and customized scaling and FOV</li>
		</ul>
		<br>
		<p>Future/in development features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Shadow mapping implemented with 3D textures</li>
			<li>Simplified shader swapping mechanics for more customized materials and per-camera postprocessing effects
				and/or alternate vertex shading</li>
			<li>Collision hit/overlap detection system</li>
			<li>Gradient skyboxes</li>
			<li>UI layers with interaction</li>
			<li>Documentation</li>
			<li>3D model importing</li>
			<li>Possibly even a proprietary GUI development environment</li>
		</ul>
